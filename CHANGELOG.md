## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.4] - 2026-09-23

### 修复 / Fixed

- 修复打包版无法打开会话的问题。Fixed an issue that prevented sessions from opening in the packaged desktop app.
- Windows 桌面版现在也能使用最新的模型目录，模型选择器会显示近期新增的模型。The Windows desktop app now receives the latest model catalog, so the model picker can show recently added models.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-09-23

### 新增 / Added

- 新增“自主工作”权限模式：AI 可自行审核工作区外的操作；理由不足时会指出疑点供助手补充，避免等待用户逐次批准。Added Autonomous Work mode: AI reviews operations outside the workspace and identifies gaps in the agent's rationale so work can continue without per-call user approval.

### 变更 / Changed

- 切换权限模式后，助手会在后续对话中收到当前模式的最新说明；按需启用的工具也会随对话恢复。After switching permission modes, the assistant receives the current mode's instructions in subsequent conversation, and tools activated on demand are restored with the conversation.
- “自主工作”模式下，助手等待问题回复达到设定时间后会收到超时提示并继续处理；模式选择器也改用独立图标和更明确的说明。In Autonomous Work mode, the assistant receives a timeout notice and can continue after the specified wait for a question reply; the mode selector now has a distinct icon and clearer descriptions.

## [0.5.2] - 2026-09-20

### 新增 / Added

- 图像生成现在支持文本加多张参考图：可直接使用会话附件、本地路径、HTTP(S) 图片 URL 或 base64 data URL，并按所选模型的输入能力发送到 OpenRouter。Image generation now supports text with multiple reference images: use session attachments, local paths, HTTP(S) image URLs, or base64 data URLs, with each request routed according to the selected model's input capabilities.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-19

### 修复 / Fixed

- 安装版里缺失最新图像模型的问题：模型选择器现在能看到 GPT Image 2.5 系列等新上线的图像模型。The installed app no longer misses the newest image models: the model picker now offers the GPT Image 2.5 family and the models released alongside it.

### 变更 / Changed

- 模型选择器更流畅：长列表只渲染屏幕内可见的模型，滚动和打开都更跟手；模型列表没有变化时不再重复加载。The model picker is smoother: long lists render only the models on screen, scrolling and opening feel more responsive, and an unchanged model list is no longer reloaded.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-19

### 新增 / Added

- 新增 AI 图像生成：常驻的 `activate_media_generation` 工具按需启用 `generate_image`，模型可以写提示词、设置参数并把图片生成到项目文件中。Added AI image generation: the always-visible `activate_media_generation` tool enables `generate_image` on demand, so the model can write prompts, set parameters, and save generated images as project files.
- 重写全局偏好设置为左侧分类、右侧选项的对话框，改为用户画像、模型与图像模型、执行环境等分组，并加入图像模型选择器。Rebuilt global preferences as a sectioned dialog with a category rail on the left and options on the right, covering the user profile, models and the image model, and the execution environment.

### 变更 / Changed

- 生成的图片不再自动用预览器打开；需要呈现给用户时，模型会先把文件放到与 Pine 共享的目录再调用呈现工具。Generated images are no longer opened in a preview automatically; to show one, the model first copies the file into a folder shared with Pine and then calls the presentation tool.
- 图像生成始终使用用户在设置中选择的模型，模型自身无法指定其它图像模型。Image generation always runs on the model the user picked in settings; the model itself cannot name a different image model.
- 新会话页背景视差增强上下方向的阻力，拉开图标之间的不透明度层次；Harness 分组本地化为“执行环境”。The new-session parallax now damps vertical travel harder and spreads icon opacity more clearly; the Harness section is localized as 执行环境.
- Pi 的模型目录可以在 Pi 发版前单独刷新（构建与发版仍基于 npm 上已发布的包），新模型不必等到下一个 Pi 版本。Pi's model catalogs can now be refreshed ahead of a Pi release while builds stay on the published npm packages, so new models no longer wait for the next Pi version.

### 修复 / Fixed

- 修复 OpenRouter 纯图像模型（如 `openai/gpt-image-2.5-flare`）报 “cannot be used with the chat/completions endpoint” 而无法出图的问题，改走 OpenRouter 专用图像 API。Fixed pure image models on OpenRouter (for example `openai/gpt-image-2.5-flare`) failing with "cannot be used with the chat/completions endpoint"; they now use OpenRouter's dedicated image API.
- 修复项目选择页背景动画让 CPU 持续接近 100% 的问题，只重绘发生变化的格子。Fixed the project start page background animation pegging the CPU near 100% by repainting only the cells that change.
- 修复呈现文件时 `project-files:preview-presented` 没有处理函数导致的报错。Fixed the `project-files:preview-presented` error thrown when presenting a file.

## [0.4.8] - 2026-09-18

### 新增 / Added

- 新增了通过拖拽的方式将对话归类到分组的功能。Added the ability to categorize conversations into groups via drag-and-drop.

### 修复 / Fixed

- 修复了自定义提供商和自定义模型无法被用户编辑或者删除的问题。Fixed an issue where custom providers and custom models could not be edited or deleted by the user.

### 变更 / Changed

- 更换了部分图标，优化视觉。Replaced some icons and optimized the visual design.

## [0.4.7] - 2026-09-17

### 修复 / Fixed

- 保留向下滚动意图下的跟随模式。Preserved follow mode on downward scroll intent.

## [0.4.6] - 2026-09-17

### 变更 / Changed

- 新增会话分组管理能力。Added session group management.

### 修复 / Fixed

- 解码 Markdown 图片路径中的百分号编码。Decode percent-encoded Markdown image paths.
- 要求明确意图后才能停止思考跟随。Require explicit intent before stopping thinking follow.

## [0.4.5] - 2026-09-17

### 修复 / Fixed

- 修复从 transcript outline 首次点击较早消息时无法完成跳转的问题，并让弹出的消息列表自动定位到当前用户消息。Fixed transcript outline navigation so the first click reaches earlier messages, and keep the popup list aligned with the current user message.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-09-16

### 新增 / Added

- 图片、HTML 等可视预览支持触控板缩放，并可平移放大后的图片。Visual previews such as images and HTML now support trackpad zoom, with panning for enlarged images.
- 新会话背景增加更均衡的图标布局和办公任务图标候选，并优化带轻微模糊的入场动画。The new-session background gains a more balanced icon layout, office-task icon candidates, and a refined entrance with subtle blur.

### 修复 / Fixed

- 切回正在流式输出的会话时，自动刷新到最新内容。Returning to a streaming session now refreshes it to the latest content automatically.
- 关闭标签页时保留横向滚动缓动和标签补位动画，并修复顶栏部分空白区域无法拖动窗口的问题。Closing tabs now preserves horizontal scroll easing and tab movement; empty title-bar areas remain draggable.
- 修复消息流式输出、窗口缩放和思考内容展开时的滚动跟随与动画。Fixed scroll following and animation during streamed messages, window resizing, and thinking expansion.
- 发送消息后，新会话背景图标立即消失。The new-session background icons now disappear immediately when a message is sent.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- Added an expandable file tree accordion with parallax and flickering-grid visuals.

### Changed

- Refined project session presentation and thinking markers.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Render markdown inline images: remote URLs load directly and local absolute or `file://` paths are served through the validated `pine-attachment://` protocol.

### Changed

- Contain offscreen transcript layout and batch streamed updates at 120ms, ending sustained high CPU during long streaming sessions; new stream deltas fade in so the sparser cadence still reads as continuous typing.
- Render thinking blocks through the markdown pipeline with a compact, muted panel variant.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-16

### Changed

- Improved streamed update handling across agent messages and runtime state.
- Refined the skill manager dialog layout.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-15

### Added

- Global and project skills, with localized skill activity in the transcript.
- Persistent approval state and execution cache-hit reporting.
- Native dragging of project files into Pine.

### Changed

- Optimized streaming transcript rendering and preserved project library order.

### Fixed

- Improved file presentation summaries and handling of missing Computer Use parameters.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- macOS packages now receive a complete ad-hoc signature whose identity is
  bound to Pine's bundle metadata, so the computer-use helper resolves the
  same Accessibility permission entity that System Settings grants.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Native computer-use controls with visible review flow and bundled platform
  runtimes for macOS and Windows.
- Background file presentation, reusable attention flashes, and clearer agent
  execution-resource and user-question guidance.
- A discrete reasoning-effort slider with animated thumb/range movement and
  thumb-anchored warning tooltips.

### Changed

- Project opening now disables the project library until loading and navigation
  finish, preventing competing interactions during the transition.
- Opening a project that is already owned by another Pine window focuses that
  window instead of creating a duplicate project runtime.
- Computer Use activation now persists for the full session, including when a
  saved session is reopened.

### Fixed

- CI desktop packaging now builds the native computer-use runtime before
  Electron Forge packages the application.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-09-14

### Added

- Bundled Sarasa Gothic SC CJK subsets as the global UI fallback after Inter,
  with Regular, SemiBold, and Bold weights.
- Documented platform support levels for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

### Changed

- Coalesced redundant sandbox file operations so Windows read/write calls launch one file worker
  and edit calls launch two, without weakening path authorization or final-file checks.
- Windows startup now completes required sandbox provisioning before opening the main window.

### Fixed

- Prevented repeated Windows sandbox setup prompts and access-denied process launches by granting
  the sandbox broker read and execute access while keeping its runtime directory protected.
- Kept Windows title-bar controls aligned with Pine's custom layout.
- Kept macOS sandbox control sockets on a short system path so deeply nested project temporary
  directories no longer break shell commands and file tools.

### Known issues

- Windows sandboxed file workers still have roughly 1.7 seconds of measured startup latency per
  process; persistent file workers require a follow-up design before sub-second file tools are possible.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Windows x64 desktop distribution with Squirrel installation and update support.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-13

### Added

- Structured user questions: the agent can present multiple-choice questions with options,
  descriptions, and previews, answered directly from the conversation.
- Each conversation now remembers its own model and provider selection.

### Fixed

- Refined the presentation of question cards and tool-call markers in the transcript.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- A titlebar button that closes the active project and returns to the project list.

### Changed

- Sidebar conversations are grouped into past three days, past week, past month, and older sections.
- Conversation rows no longer show a date, leaving the full row width to titles.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Preserved Electron's built-in SQLite module in production bundles so projects can open correctly.
- Removed a blocked remote font request and kept the bundled Inter variable font as the UI font source.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- A local-first Electron workspace for project-scoped AI agent sessions.
- Project file browsing and previews for text, image, PDF, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files.
- Review, auto-approve, and unrestricted execution modes with visible tool activity.
- Configurable model providers, custom models, themes, localization, and persistent sessions.
- Reproducible main-branch artifacts and a manually gated production release workflow.
- R2-backed update discovery, verified downloads, and in-app macOS replacement updates.
